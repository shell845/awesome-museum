## Project summary
The purpose of this project is to collect and present information about museums (US only at current stage, may extend to global in next pharse), including museum categories, locations, ratings and more. 

## Source data
Datasets are collected from Kaggle and Tripadvisor and are uploaded to AWS S3 `s3://udacity-dend-shell845/museum-data/`

1. **museum** overall summary of museums extracted from Tripadvisor. In csv format.

	`Address, Description, FeatureCount, Fee, Langtitude, Latitude, LengthOfVisit, MuseumName, PhoneNum, Rank, Rating, ReviewCount,TotalThingsToDo`
	
2. **category** categories of museums, e.g. art museum, history museum, science museum etc. In json format.
