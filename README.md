## Project summary
This project collects and presents information about museums (US only at current stage, will extend to global in next pharse), including museum categories, locations, ratings and more. 

Output can be used by travelers, museum fans and travel companies for trip planning, as well can be used by museum marketing department and data analysts for study and analyse.

## Project structure
This reposity contains following materials:

1. **`aws.cfg`** contains all configuration parameters. Please input following parameters before executing the ETL pipeline.

2. **`helper`** foler contains following helper functions:

	- `create_drop_tables.py` drop and creat redshift tables
	- `data_quality.py` data quality check
	- `sql_queries.py` all sql queries used in this project
	- `transform_data.py` functions to process data and transform table
	
	
3. **`etl.py`** is the ETL pipleline

4. **`small_dataset`** datasets in smaller size for testing purpose

5. **`awesome-museum.ipynb`** is a Jupyter notebook for testing and can be used as dashboard.


## Instruction
Please follow below steps to run this project:

**Step 1: Fill in `aws.cfg`**
	
```
[KEYS]
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your_access_id>
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your_access_key>
	
[CLUSTER]
HOST=<your_redshift_host>
DB_NAME=<your_redshift_db_name>
DB_USER=<your_redshift_db_user>

[IAM_ROLE]
ARN=<your_arn>
	
[FILTER]
COUNTRY=United States
DATE=2012-10-01
```

Notes for [FILTER] section:

- for COUNTRY, we only have dataset for United States at current stage. 
- for DATE, we only have dataset up to 2013-09-01, every first day of each month.


**Step 2: Remove folder `museum-output` and `weather-output` if they already exist in your S3 directory.**

**Step 3: Execute `etl.py`**

Note: You may change to use smaller size source dataset in `small_dataset` for testing.

## Source data
Datasets are collected from Kaggle and Tripadvisor and are uploaded to AWS S3 `s3://udacity-dend-shell845/museum-data/`

### DB diagram
![DB Diagram](DB-diagram.png)

## ETL pipeline
The ETL pipeline includes following steps:

1. Clean and re-format raw data
	- Load raw data for **museum** and **weather** from S3 to Spark, since these 2 datasets are too big to be processed directly in Redshift.
	- Clean **museum** and **weather** raw data with Spark, output transformed data to S3 as parquet files.
	- Clean and re-format **category** and **traveler** dataset, output re-formatted data to S3 as json files.
2. Load cleaned and well-formatted dataset from S3 to Redshift staging tables.
3. Conduct data quality check to ensure data are loaded succesfully to Redshift.
4. Transform staging tables to fact and dimension tables in Redshift.
5. Perform data quality check to ensure data transformation is correct.

![ETL Pipeline](elt-diagram.png)

## Data quality check
Check record counts of each data to ensure data are properly processed. Can select and display sample data if want further exam the data quality.

## Tools and technologies
S3, Spark and Redshift are use in this project.

Will further adopt Airflow for pipeline management in next pharse.

## Usage
Museum lovers can make reference to the project dataset for their trip plannings.

Travel agencies can make use of this project for travel recommendations as well.

Data analysts from travel industry can use this project output to predict if a museum will be popular with market, and study what factors make a museum popular.

Museum staff can get intuitve feedback on how visitors view their museum.


## Other scenarios
1. If the data was increased by 100x.

	Spark will be used to process all raw datasets. Redshift cluster will be expanded.

2. If the pipelines would be run on a daily basis by 7 am every day.

	Airflow will be used for pipelines scheduling.

3. If the database needed to be accessed by 100+ people.

	If those people only need to view the project result, then they should not access the database directly. Instead the result will be visualized by visualization tool e.g Tableau, Power BI etc. Only the visualization tool access database, people only check results from the tool.
	
	If those people need read write to the database, an IAM group will be assigned to them.

## Next phase
1. Adopt Airflow for pipeline management.
2. Visualize the data.
2. Extend the dataset to including reviewer comments, study the relationship between rating and different key words in the comments.
