### DB diagram
![DB-diagram](DB-diagram.png)

## ETL pipeline
The ETL pipeline includes following steps:

1. Load raw data for **museum** and **weather** from S3 to Spark, since these 2 datasets are too big to be processed directly in Redshift.
2. Process **museum** and **weather** raw data with Spark, output transformed data to S3 as parquet files.
3. Load processed dataset **museum** and **weather** as well as small raw datasets **category**, **rating** and **traveler** from S3 to Redshift staging tables.
4. Conduct data quality check to ensure data are loaded succesfully to Redshift.
5. Transform staging tables to fact and dimension tables in Redshift.
6. Perform data quality check to ensure data transformation is correct.
7. Analyze data.

## Data quality check

## Tools and technologies

## Usage
Museum lovers can make reference to the project dataset for their trip plannings.

Travel agencies can make use of this project for travel recommendations as well.

Data analysts from travel industry can use this project output to predict if a museum will be popular with market, and study what factors make a museum popular.

Museum staff can get intuitve feedback on how visitors view their museum.


## Other Scenarios
1. If the data was increased by 100x.
2. If the pipelines would be run on a daily basis by 7 am every day.
3. If the database needed to be accessed by 100+ people.
